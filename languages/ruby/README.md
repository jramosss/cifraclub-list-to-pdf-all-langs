# How to use

# Conclussions:
- Super hard to install at first glance, turns out i already had ruby installed (i guess it comes by default with your machine) but outdated. Then i had to install RVM, and use bundle to install, but there's also gem?. The way to install RVM is kinda complicated and it does not run first try.
- Then i installed rbenv which is a bit easier to handle, but still super hard to setup and get autocompletions
