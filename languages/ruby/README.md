# Cifraclub list to PDF - Ruby - HttpParty - Puppeteer

# How to use
- bundle install
- ruby benchmark.ts

# Conclussions:
- Super hard to install at first glance, turns out i already had ruby installed (i guess it comes by default with your machine) but outdated. Then i had to install RVM, and use bundle to install, but there's also gem?. The way to install RVM is kinda complicated and it does not run first try.
- Then i installed rbenv which is a bit easier to handle, but still super hard to setup and get autocompletions
- Once you suffered through installation, language is pretty nice, there are always idiomatic and functional ways of doing stuff
- Parallel is great, just do a .map of your function that you want to run in parallel and it works
- Overall bad experience because of how hard it was to setup, but language feels nice and i'm sure that rails solves most of the bad stuff
- Pretty fast, more than i expected
