# Cifraclub PDF generator

If you are a musician, you probably know the website [Cifraclub](https://www.cifraclub.com/). It is a great website to find chords and tabs for your favorite songs. However, if you want to have all your songs in one place, you'll have to go through the process of downloading every song individually. This can be a very time-consuming process. This is why I created this script. It will download all songs from your list and save them in a PDF file.
