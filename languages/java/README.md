# Cifraclub to PDF - Java - JSoup + Jackson + Playwright

## How to run
Who knows, just use intellij

## Conclusions:
**HATED this language, worst of all no doubt**

- Installing a dependency is super complicated, and there are 3 different ways of doing it but none of them is a good one
- Even the simplest stuff is super complicated, making an http request takes like 15 lines
- Everything throws an exception, and i understand that is the philosophy of the language but you can't be try/catching everything
- I had to install a new dep to parse json, how come a long running language like Java doesn't have built in json parsing?
- Thank god Playwright exists, the other options (openhtmltopdf) are a nightmare
- Even after all this suffering, this language is one of the slowest!!!! HOW COME
