# Cifraclub to PDF - Rust - scraper + headless_chrome

## How to run
- cargo build --release
- ./target/release/cifraclub_scraper

## Conclusions:
- So hard to learn, i understood nothing, everything here is difficult and so different to other languages, and it's not like i've never used a low level lang before, but this is nothing close to c++ even.
- Tried to make such a "high level" feature with a low level language, not fun
- Not fun at all, i did not enjoy this experiment
- Compiling takes a long time, like 80 seconds to build a project with 7 dependencies
