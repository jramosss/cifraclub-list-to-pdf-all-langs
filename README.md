# What is this?

When i was starting in the world of programming, i thought i needed to know all the languages so i will be a real programmer, and then everybody started telling me to pick just one and master it, they told me not to try and learn how to write hello world in 50 languages.  

Now, 5 years apart from that, i know that i don't need to, but i want to, so i will take a project that i made ([Cifraclub list to pdf](https://github.com/jramosss/cifraclub-cancionero)), since it's a really tiny project that demonstrates value really fast so i will grab that and try to make it in as many languages as i can, and i will try to make it in the most idiomatic way possible, so i will be learning the language while doing it.

I will be documentating my journey in this repository, so expect big things.
